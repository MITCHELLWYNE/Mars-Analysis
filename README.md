# Mars-Analysis
## Part 1

### Web-Scraping Data
**Mars News**

__Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.__

- Extract all the text Elements
- Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures

**Scrape the Table**
-
- Format data into pd DataFrame

**Analyze The Data**
-
1. How many months exist on Mars?

__12__

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

__1867__

3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
- Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
- Plot the results as a bar chart.

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
- Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
- Plot the results as a bar chart.

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
- Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
- Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
